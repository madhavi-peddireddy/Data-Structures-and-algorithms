## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git

```


🛠️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine to run the code examples. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from Python.org or use an online compiler.

🚀 Usage
Each directory contains source code files related to a specific data structure or algorithm. You can run these files using the following commands:

```bash
python filename.py

```

Replace filename.py with the name of the source code file you want to run.

Happy coding! 🚀
